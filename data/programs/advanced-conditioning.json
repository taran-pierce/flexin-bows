  "content" : "When  you are proficient in performing the exercise techniques of the above workout and are no longer realizing results, or have become just plain bored, it is time to change your program. You can increase your training with thi 'split system' routine that works opposing muscle groups on different days. To do this, you will increase your resistance when you can perform 12 reps perfectly and you will increase you volume by performing more sets and more exercises. Move slowly on each rep. Use a pace that would allow you to stop the movement instantly at any point in the rep. Count three seconds up and three seconds down and work to fatigue during each set.",
