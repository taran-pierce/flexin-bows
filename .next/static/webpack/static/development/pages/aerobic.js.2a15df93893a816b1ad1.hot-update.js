By returning to an aerobic exercise between each set you are increasing your aerobic capacity, endurance, and burning fat as energy. The idea is to move quickly from exercise to exercise, taking only as much rest between sets as it takes to set up the next exercise (less than 20 seconds). One circuit equals one set of each exercise. Initially, start with completing one round of Circuit 1. Then add an additional round fo the same circuit. Once you reach three round sof Circuit 1, add one round of Circuit 2. Add additional rounds of Circuit 2 as your fitness level increases. Repeat the process with Circuit 3. Do not let your heart rate exceed 220, minus your resting hear rate. Perform each rep of each exercise slowly. Count three seconds up and three seconds down.","workout":{"days":[{"title":"Circuit 1","id":"aerobic-1","bodyParts":[{"name":"Chest","exercises":[{"name":"Bench Press","fileName":"bench-press-horizontal"}],"sets":"1","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Aerobic Exercise","exercises":[{"name":"30 - 60 Seconds","fileName":"cross-over-rear-deltoid"}],"sets":"1","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Legs","exercises":[{"name":"Leg Press","fileName":"leg-press"}],"sets":"1","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Aerobic Exercise","exercises":[{"name":"30 - 60 Seconds","fileName":"cross-over-rear-deltoid"}],"sets":"1","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Back","exercises":[{"name":"Seated Lat Rows","fileName":"cross-over-rear-deltoid"}],"sets":"1","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Aerobic Exercise","exercises":[{"name":"30 - 60 Seconds","fileName":"cross-over-rear-deltoid"}],"sets":"1","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Legs","exercises":[{"name":"Calf Raise","fileName":"calf-raise"}],"sets":"1","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Aerobic Exercise","exercises":[{"name":"30 - 60 Seconds","fileName":"cross-over-rear-deltoid"}],"sets":"1","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Trunk","exercises":[{"name":"Trunk Rotation","fileName":"trunk-rotation"}],"sets":"1","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Aerobic Exercise","exercises":[{"name":"30 - 60 Seconds","fileName":"cross-over-rear-deltoid"}],"sets":"1","reps":"10 - 15"}]},{"title":"Circuit 2","id":"aerobic-2","bodyParts":[{"name":"Shoulders","exercises":[{"name":"Seated Shoulder Press","fileName":"bench-press-horizontal"}],"sets":"1","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Aerobic Exercise","exercises":[{"name":"30 - 60 Seconds","fileName":"cross-over-rear-deltoid"}],"sets":"1","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Legs","exercises":[{"name":"Leg Extension","fileName":"leg-extension"}],"sets":"1","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Aerobic Exercise","exercises":[{"name":"30 - 60 Seconds","fileName":"cross-over-rear-deltoid"}],"sets":"1","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Back","exercises":[{"name":"Reverse Grip Pulldown","fileName":"reverse-grip-pulldown"}],"sets":"1","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Aerobic Exercise","exercises":[{"name":"30 - 60 Seconds","fileName":"cross-over-rear-deltoid"}],"sets":"1","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Trunk","exercises":[{"name":"Trunk Rotation","fileName":"trunk-rotation"}],"sets":"1","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Aerobic Exercise","exercises":[{"name":"30 - 60 Seconds","fileName":"cross-over-rear-deltoid"}],"sets":"1","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Arms","exercises":[{"name":"Standing Biceps Curl","fileName":"bicep-curl"}],"sets":"1","reps":"10 - 15"}]}]}};
