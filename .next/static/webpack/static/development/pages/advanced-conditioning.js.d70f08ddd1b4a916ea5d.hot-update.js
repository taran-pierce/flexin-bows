You can increase your training with thi 'split system' routine that works opposing muscle groups on different days. To do this, you will increase your resistance when you can perform 12 reps perfectly and you will increase you volume by performing more sets and more exercises. Move slowly on each rep. Use a pace that would allow you to stop the movement instantly at any point in the rep. Count three seconds up and three seconds down and work to fatigue during each set.","workout":{"days":[{"title":"1 & 3","id":"advanced-conditioning-1-3","bodyParts":[{"name":"Chest","exercises":[{"name":"Decline Bench Press","fileName":"decline-bench-press"},{"name":"Bench Press","fileName":"Bench Press"}],"sets":"1 - 2","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Shoulders","exercises":[{"name":"Seated Shoulder Press","fileName":"cross-over-rear-deltoid"},{"name":"Crossover Seated Rear Deltoid","fileName":"cross-over-rear-detoid"},{"name":"Front Shoulder Raise","fileName":"cross-over-rear-deltiod"},{"name":"Scapular Retraction","fileName":"cross-over-rear-deltiod"}],"sets":"1 - 2","reps":"10 - 15"}]},{"title":"2 & 4","id":"advanced-conditioning-2-4","bodyParts":[{"name":"Back","exercises":[{"name":"Seated Lat Rows","fileName":"shoulder-extension"},{"name":"Reverse Grip Pulldowns","fileName":"shoulder-extension"}],"sets":"1 - 2","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Arms","exercises":[{"name":"Standing Biceps Curl","fileName":"bicep-curl"},{"name":"Standing Wrist Curl","fileName":"bicep-curl"},{"name":"Triceps Pushdown","fileName":"triceps-pushdown"},{"name":"Lying Triceps Extension","fileName":"bicep-curl"}],"sets":"1 - 2","reps":"10 - 15"}]},{"title":"5 & 7","id":"advanced-conditioning-5-7","bodyParts":[{"name":"Legs","exercises":[{"name":"Leg Press","fileName":"calf-raise"},{"name":"Leg Extension","fileName":"trunk-rotation"},{"name":"Standing Leg Kickback","fileName":"calf-raise"},{"name":"Seated Hip Abduction","fileName":"trunk-rotation"}],"sets":"1-2","reps":"10-15"},{"name":"Trunk","exercises":[{"name":"Seated Abdominal Crunch","fileName":"abdominal-crunch"},{"name":"Trunk Rotation","fileName":"abdominal-crunch"}],"sets":"1-2","reps":"10-15"}]}]}};
