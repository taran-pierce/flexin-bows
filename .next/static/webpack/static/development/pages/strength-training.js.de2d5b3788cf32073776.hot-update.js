Reset 60 - 120 seconds between each set and exercise. Focus on proper form. Tighten the muscle before you move, squeeze the muscle as you move, cramp the muscle as the point of full contraction, and resist the movement as you lower the weight. Move slowly on each rep, use a pace that would allow you to stop the movement instantly at any point in the rep.
