Warm up with a light resistance that you can perform easily for 5/10 reps without fatigue. Focus on practicing and learning your technique before increasing the resistance. Then move to a more challenging resistance that you can perform no less than 10 reps and no more than 15 reps. As you become stronger, you can advance to two sets for each exercise. Complete all sets of each exercise before moving ont to the next one. Res 30 to 45 seconds between sets. Move slowly on each repo. Use a pace that would allow you to stop the movement instantly at any point in the repo. Count three seconds up and threes seconds down and work to fatigue during each set.","workout":{"days":[{"title":"M-W-F","id":"better-body-M-W-F","bodyParts":[{"name":"Chest","exercises":[{"name":"Bench Press","fileName":"bench-press-horizontal"}],"sets":"1 - 2","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Back","exercises":[{"name":"Seated Lat Rows","fileName":"shoulder-extension"}],"sets":"1 - 2","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Shoulders","exercises":[{"name":"Crossover Seated Rear Deltoid Rows","fileName":"cross-over-rear-deltiod"}],"sets":"1 - 2","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Arms","exercises":[{"name":"Standing Biceps Curl","fileName":"bicep-curl"},{"name":"Triceps Pushdown","fileName":"triceps-pushdown.jpg"}],"sets":"1 - 2","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Legs","exercises":[{"name":"Calf Raise","fileName":"calf-raise"},{"name":"Leg Press","fileName":"leg-press"}],"sets":"1 - 2","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Trunk","exercises":[{"name":"Trunk Rotation","fileName":"trunk-rotation"},{"name":"Seated Abdominal Crunch","fileName":"abdominal-crunch"}],"sets":"1 - 2","reps":"10 - 15"}]}]}};
