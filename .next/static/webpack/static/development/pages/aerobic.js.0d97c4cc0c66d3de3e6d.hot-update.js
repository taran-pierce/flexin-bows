By returning to an aerobic exercise between each set you are increasing your aerobic capacity, endurance, and burning fat as energy. The idea is to move quickly from exercise to exercise, taking only as much rest between sets as it takes to set up the next exercise (less than 20 seconds). One circuit equals one set of each exercise. Initially, start with completing one round of Circuit 1. Then add an additional round fo the same circuit. Once you reach three round sof Circuit 1, add one round of Circuit 2. Add additional rounds of Circuit 2 as your fitness level increases. Repeat the process with Circuit 3. Do not let your heart rate exceed 220, minus your resting hear rate. Perform each rep of each exercise slowly. Count three seconds up and three seconds down.","workout":{"days":[{"title":"Circuit 1","id":"aerobic-1","bodyParts":[{"name":"Chest","exercises":[{"name":"Decline Bench Press","fileName":"decline-bench-press"},{"name":"Bench Press","fileName":"Bench Press"}],"sets":"1 - 2","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Shoulders","exercises":[{"name":"Seated Shoulder Press","fileName":"cross-over-rear-deltoid"},{"name":"Crossover Seated Rear Deltoid","fileName":"cross-over-rear-detoid"},{"name":"Front Shoulder Raise","fileName":"cross-over-rear-deltiod"},{"name":"Scapular Retraction","fileName":"cross-over-rear-deltiod"}],"sets":"1 - 2","reps":"10 - 15"}]},{"title":"Circuit 2","id":"aerobic-2","bodyParts":[{"name":"Back","exercises":[{"name":"Seated Lat Rows","fileName":"shoulder-extension"},{"name":"Reverse Grip Pulldowns","fileName":"shoulder-extension"}],"sets":"1 - 2","reps":"10 - 15"},{"name":"Arms","exercises":[{"name":"Standing Biceps Curl","fileName":"bicep-curl"},{"name":"Standing Wrist Curl","fileName":"bicep-curl"},{"name":"Triceps Pushdown","fileName":"triceps-pushdown"},{"name":"Lying Triceps Extension","fileName":"bicep-curl"}],"sets":"1 - 2","reps":"10 - 15"}]},{"title":"5 & 7","id":"aerobic-5-7","bodyParts":[{"name":"Legs","exercises":[{"name":"Leg Press","fileName":"calf-raise"},{"name":"Leg Extension","fileName":"trunk-rotation"},{"name":"Standing Leg Kickback","fileName":"calf-raise"},{"name":"Seated Hip Abduction","fileName":"trunk-rotation"}],"sets":"1-2","reps":"10-15"},{"name":"Trunk","exercises":[{"name":"Seated Abdominal Crunch","fileName":"abdominal-crunch"},{"name":"Trunk Rotation","fileName":"abdominal-crunch"}],"sets":"1-2","reps":"10-15"}]}]}};
